Of course. This is a fantastic project that deserves a professional and comprehensive README. A good README file is the front door to your project; it should explain the "what," "why," and "how" clearly.

Based on the collection of scripts you provided, here is a complete GitHub README file. I've structured it to tell the story of the project, explain its components, and guide a new user on how to run it.

A data-driven toolkit designed to provide ranchers and agricultural professionals with actionable insights for optimizing cattle feed costs and monitoring environmental conditions. This project combines agricultural science, web scraping for economic data, and API integration for environmental data to build a practical decision-support system.

Project Overview

Ranching operates on thin margins where operational costs and environmental factors are critical variables. The two largest drivers of cost and productivity are feed expenses and weather-related stress on the herd.

This toolkit tackles both of these challenges by providing two main modules:

The Economic Engine: Calculates the nutritional needs of a cattle herd and scrapes real-time prices from a feed supplier's website to find the most cost-effective feeding strategy.

The Environmental Monitor: Fetches high-quality, localized weather data from the NOAA API to create a historical record of environmental conditions like temperature and humidity, which directly impact cattle health and feed intake.

The ultimate goal is to merge these two modules to create a smart system that can recommend feed adjustments based on predicted environmental stressors.

Core Features
üìà Economic Engine (cows_2.py, cow_save_scrape.py)

Scientific DMI Calculation: Accurately calculates the Dry Matter Intake (DMI) required for different types of cattle (lactating, growing, pregnant) based on peer-reviewed agricultural formulas.

Dynamic User Input: A command-line interface prompts the user for herd-specific details (number of cows, weight, lactation stage, etc.).

Real-Time Price Scraping: A robust web scraper built with BeautifulSoup fetches current product names and prices from a feed store's e-commerce site.

Cost Optimization: Analyzes the scraped data to present the user with the most and least expensive options to meet their herd's nutritional demands.

üå¶Ô∏è Environmental Monitor (weather_1.py)

NOAA API Integration: Connects to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) v2 API to access a vast repository of official weather data.

Targeted Data Fetching: Pulls specific, relevant data types (TMAX, TMIN, RH_AVG, etc.) for a predefined list of local weather stations.

Robust Error Handling: Includes comprehensive try...except blocks to manage API request errors, JSON decoding issues, and unexpected responses.

Structured Data Output: Saves the fetched weather data into organized JSON files, creating a local, structured database of environmental conditions.

Project Architecture

The toolkit operates as a data pipeline:

Herd Profiling (User Input): The user runs cows_2.py and provides the basic characteristics of their herd.

Nutritional Demand Calculation: The script uses built-in formulas to calculate the total required Dry Matter Intake (DMI) in pounds.

Market Price Acquisition (Web Scraping): The script then automatically scrapes the Berend Bros. feed store website to get a list of available feeds and their current prices.

Economic Analysis & Recommendation: It calculates the total cost for each feed to meet the DMI demand and presents a sorted list of the most economical options.

Environmental Data Collection (API Call): Separately, the weather_1.py script can be run to fetch historical weather data for a list of stations around College Station, TX, saving the results for future analysis.

Technical Stack

Language: Python 3

Data Scraping & Manipulation:

requests: For making HTTP requests to the NOAA API and websites.

BeautifulSoup4: For parsing HTML and scraping web data.

pandas: For data structuring and analysis (used in earlier versions).

External APIs:

NOAA Climate Data Online API v2

This project is a functional prototype with significant potential for expansion. Future development will focus on integrating the two core modules.
